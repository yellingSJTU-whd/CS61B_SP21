modified but not staged:
1. file tracked, working tree sha1 ≠ commit tree sha1 --> there is some modification since last commit
2. file tracked, not in commit tree but in stage tree, while working tree sha1 (≠null) ≠ stage tree sha1
3. file tracked, not in commit tree but in stage tree, while working tree sha1 = null (file removed) ≠ stage tree sha1
4. file tracked, in commit tree (commit tree sha1 == staging tree sha1), while working tree sha1 = null
